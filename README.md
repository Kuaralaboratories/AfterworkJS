## Getting Started

To get started with Afterwork.js, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Afterwork.js**

   ```bash
   npm install kuaralabs-afterworkjs
   ```

2. **Create Your Server**

   Create a file named `server.js`:

   ```typescript
   import { AfterworkJS } from 'afterworkjs';

   // you can use dotenv
   const SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key';  // Replace with your actual secret key
   const DB_URL = 'your_database_url';    // Replace with your actual database URL
   const DB_NAME = 'your_database_name';  // Replace with your actual database name
   
   const app = new AfterworkJS({
     secret: SECRET_KEY,
     dbType: "postgres",                  // Replace with the databases that is supported
     dbConfig: {
       dbUrl: DB_URL,
       dbName: DB_NAME
     }
   });

   app.addRoute('get', '/hello', (req, res, next) => {
     res.json({ message: 'Hello, world!' });
   });

   app.start(3000);
   ```

3. **Run Your Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Your server will be running on port 3000.

## Features

- **Simple Routing**: Define routes with ease using `addRoute`.
- **Middleware Support**: Easily add middleware for request processing.
- **Database Integration**: Supports MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL out of the box.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure your routes with JSON Web Tokens.

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use Afterwork.js for routing and middleware:

```typescript
import { AfterworkJS } from 'afterworkjs';

// you can use dotenv
const SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key';  // Replace with your actual secret key
const DB_URL = 'your_database_url';    // Replace with your actual database URL
const DB_NAME = 'your_database_name';  // Replace with your actual database name

const app = new AfterworkJS({
  secret: SECRET_KEY,
  dbType: "postgres",                  // Replace with the databases that is supported
  dbConfig: {
    dbUrl: DB_URL,
    dbName: DB_NAME
  }
});

// Middleware to log requests
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
});

// Route to handle GET requests
app.addRoute('get', '/users', async (req, res) => {
  const users = await req.db.find('users', {});
  res.json(users);
});

// Start the server
app.start(3000);
```
